# Visual Programming Assignment

## ðŸŽ‰ A login screen with cool interface! 

![asd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Elvin-Arrow/Visual-Programming-Assignment/login/screenshot.png "Login module screenshot")

This branch (`login`) contains the following important files/folders:

1. File â€” Demo.mov
    
    This shows a working demo of the login module.

2. Folder â€” WPFApp
    
    This houses the VS project files


ðŸ˜¬ I downloaded the project files from `master` branch and tried to run it but there was error related to the version of the database. So that's I wasn't able to integrate my login screen to your project files.

Here's the error code:
```
SqlException: The database '\\VBOXSVR\SHARED\VP_ASSIGNMENT\VISUAL PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENT\BIN\DEBUG\STOREDB.MDF' cannot be opened because it is version 852. This server supports version 782 and earlier. A downgrade path is not supported.
Could not open new database '\\VBOXSVR\SHARED\VP_ASSIGNMENT\VISUAL PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENT\BIN\DEBUG\STOREDB.MDF'. CREATE DATABASE is aborted.
